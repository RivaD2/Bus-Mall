# Bus-Mall
## Overview:

**The BusMall project challenge was to build an app that displays potential 
products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side)**

**The app’s purpose is to have group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase.
I had to store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data using Chart.js.**

* This involved creating an algorithm that randomly generates three unique product images and displays them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window
* Attached an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed
* Generated three new products for the user to pick from once the user ‘clicks’ a product
* Updated the newly added property to reflect if it was clicked after every selection by the viewer
* Used ChartJS (imported from CDN) to display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format and adding local storage.
