# Bus-Mall
## Overview:

The BusMall project challenge was to build an app that displays potential 
products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side)

The appâ€™s purpose is to have group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase.
I had to store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data using Chart.js.
